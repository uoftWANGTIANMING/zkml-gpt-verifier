day: 2
topic: "Halo2 Playground - Additive Constraint"
setup:
  - Used halo2_proofs dependency
  - Built a minimal circuit enforcing a + b = c
  - Added CLI input parsing for dynamic witness values
tests:
  - input: [2, 3, 5]
    result: satisfied
  - input: [2, 3, 6]
    result: unsatisfied
observations:
  - Circuit enforces relation a + b = c using Halo2 constraints
  - Private inputs (a, b) remain hidden; only public c is exposed
  - Verification fails when constraint is not satisfied
next_steps:
  - Try multiplicative constraint (a * b = c)
  - Explore combining multiple constraints into one circuit
