day: 3
topic: "CUDA + JAX + Triton Environment"
setup:
  - Verified GPU passthrough in WSL2 (nvidia-smi shows RTX 3070 Ti, CUDA 12.6)
  - Created Python venv under ~ and installed:
    - jax[cuda12_local]
    - torch (cu126 wheels)
    - triton
tests:
  - JAX: `print(jax.devices())` => GpuDevice(id=0)
  - Triton: custom add kernel ran on CUDA; output = x + y
observations:
  - Avoid running Triton kernels from stdin; use .py file so jit can read source
  - Keep venv and code under Linux home (not /mnt/c) for fewer permission issues
next_steps:
  - Day 4: run ezkl MNIST demo with GPU
  - Optional: add a tiny benchmark to compare CPU vs GPU
