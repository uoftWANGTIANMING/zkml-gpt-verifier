# Halo2 Introduction Notes

## Setup
- Installed Rust and Cargo
- Cloned `zcash/halo2` repository
- Environment check

## Test Circuit
- Ran the `test-circuit` example
- Verified proof generation and verification steps

## Observations
- Constraint system design feels modular
- Polynomial commitments are central
- Need to study how custom gates are defined

## Next Steps
- Explore a minimal custom circuit
- Write annotated walkthrough of the prover and verifier code
